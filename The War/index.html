It looks like one of those ultra-sanitization medical rooms. Or perhaps a type of insane asylum? Either way it was weird. You see a door on the far side. \n\n[[[Move to enter the door]]]\n[[[Try to go back out]]]\n</div><div tiddler="Try to escape with Yolan" tags="" created="201502190924" modifier="twee" twine-position="1083,2038">You fire at one of the guards, dropping him to the ground, another raises his rifle but Yolan elbows him in the face, you shoot a third and you and Yolan sprint out the jail. By sheer luck you manage to make it out of the city. \n\nOnce you return to the covert ops headquarters, Yolan informs Sanchez of your actions, and you're dismissed from the program. You and Yolan remain good friends though, as he still feels as though he owes you a life debt, despite the fact you compromised the mission.\n\nFrom time to time, you meet up to talk about the days during the war. But from now on, your life is devoid of any explosions or guns. </div><div tiddler="Garland in Action" tags="" created="201502182015" modifier="twee" twine-position="608,1350">You drop your pistol the ground. The guard immediately aims his gun at you, and the moment before he fires, Garland slams her boot into his shin, breaking it. He collapses to the ground and she quickly breaks his neck.\n\n&quot;Come on,&quot; Garland says, &quot;we have to keep moving.&quot; You sneak low moving the past the guards. Then, you realize you left your pistol behind and no longer have a gun. You whisper this to Garland, after you're clear of the border patrol and she shakes her head in annoyance. &quot;Here, she says, handing you a long combat knife, &quot;this is the best I can spare.&quot; \n\n[[&quot;I can't do this&quot;|The Coward]]\n[[&quot;Ok, thanks&quot;|Into the Fortress]]</div><div tiddler="&quot;Let's toss them.&quot;" tags="" created="201502190904" modifier="twee" twine-position="1355,1770">&quot;Alright, let's try it,&quot; says Yolan. He begins unpacking the explosives. &quot;Get ready to throw,&quot; and he hurls a pack towards the generator it falls near a squad of guards who immediately notice you. &quot;Goddamn it,&quot; swears Yolan, &quot;time to go,&quot; he throws one pack of explosives and turns tail to run. \n\n[[Follow Him]]\n[[Run the rest of the explosives at the generator|Running with Bombs]]</div><div tiddler="go directly to the governor" tags="" created="201502190917" modifier="twee" twine-position="1078,1906">You decide to go directly to the city governor. You approach the town hall and the guards immediately seize you. However, when you tell them you need to warn the governor of an impending attack, they strip you of your weapons and lead you into his office. \n\nYou inform him that the training facility is about to come under attack, and he immediately sends word to the camp commander. \n\nA few hours later, you're sitting in a holding cell when you see the guards lead Yolan in, bruised and bloody. \n\n&quot;You damn fool,&quot; he says when he sees you. \n\nThe governor enters behind him. &quot;Now, you have two choices,&quot; he says, [[execute this man and prove your loyalty to our cause|kill Yolan]] or [[spend the rest of your life in prison|Permanently Imprisoned]].&quot;</div><div tiddler="The Coward" tags="" created="201502182020" modifier="twee" twine-position="214,1210">&quot;What do mean you can't do this?&quot; Garland demands in an angry whisper. You shake your head in terror, and she sighs. &quot;It's understandable. We should never send rookies straight into the field. Here,&quot; she hands you a week's worth of survival rations, &quot;good luck getting back Rookie.&quot;\n\nYou barely manage to sneak past the border again undetected. But you make it home and avoid the rest of the war. Years later, you meeting Garland again at the market, she's badly scarred but still looks healthy, &quot;Good to see you again&quot; she says, &quot;Glad you made it through the war.&quot; She shakes your hand firmly and walks away. </div><div tiddler="Wait until Dawn to travel to the Safe House" tags="" created="201502181751" modifier="twee" twine-position="1661,154">We laid our heads to rest for the night.\n\nI awoke to a pounding knock on the apartment door. Demetri jumped up and reached for his gun. &quot;We have a warrant for your arrest! This door better be open in 10 Seconds or I'll bust it down and take you in, dead or alive!&quot; the voice said.\n\n[[Open the Door]]\n[[Don't Open the Door]]</div><div tiddler="&quot;Let's do it.&quot;" tags="" created="201502182201" modifier="twee" twine-position="1369,1642">&quot;Alright, glad you're on board.

You sneak past the outer perimeter and inside the facility, keeping to the shadows and squads of troupes march past. \n\n&quot;Time to blow this place,&quot; whispers Yolan, gesturing towards a massive power generator in the center of the facility. Here's the catch, there's no good way to get close, so we'll either need to toss the explosives or run them directly up to the generator in plain sight.&quot;\n\n[[&quot;Let's toss them.&quot;]]\n[[&quot;I'll run them in&quot;|Running with Bombs]]\n[[&quot;Why don't you run them in&quot;]]</div><div tiddler="[Try to get someone's attention and ask for help" tags="" created="201502222254" modifier="twee" twine-position="680,326">You call out to the nearest man in a white coat.\n\n&quot;Hey I'm looking for where new Army recruits are supposed to be...?&quot;\n\nHe man responds, &quot;Oh so you have come to serve your country?

You remember Garland telling you that your target was the server room. \n\nYou head through the base, sticking to the shadows and trying to find the server room. \n\nFinally, you realize you have no idea where you're going. You decide you can either capture a guard and try to find out where the server is, or plant the explosives and get out before you're discovered. \n\n[[Capture a Guard|Interrogation]]\n[[Bring it Down|Blowing up Headquarters]]</div><div tiddler="Head for the border" tags="" created="201502181750" modifier="twee" twine-position="1232,158">Going home was too risky. I headed for the border. It was a 12 hour drive and I had just enough money to make it across the border and find a place to settle down for a few weeks until I figured out a plan. \n\nI tried avoiding the interstate and the main roads just in case I was identified as a dodger. I was 8 hours into the drive. There was a small town I took a detour through to rest. It was unusually quiet. There seemed to be plenty of businesses but not a person in sight. Then blue lights began to flash. I looked in my rear view mirror and the police were pulling me over.\n\n[[Pull Over]]\n[[Try to Lose Them]]\n</div><div tiddler="Interrogation" tags="" created="201502182122" modifier="twee" twine-position="417,1764">You sneak up and a grab a guard, pressing the barrel of Garland's SMG into his back. &quot;Tell me where the server room is or you die&quot; you hiss to the guard. &quot;Around this building and to your right,&quot; he whispers back tremulously. \n\n[[Kill Him|In the Server Room Undetected]]\n[[Leave Him Alive|In the Server Room Detected]]</div><div tiddler="StoryTitle" tags="" created="201502121614" modifier="twee" twine-position="3,315">The War </div><div tiddler="Running with Bombs" tags="" created="201502190905" modifier="twee" twine-position="1495,1909">You grab up a pack of explosives and make quick eye contact with Yolan, he nods grimly. You sprint towards the generator. The soldiers see you and open fire, Yolan returns fire from the cover of a nearby building and they scatter. Two bullets catch you, one in the hip and one in the shoulder but you keep running. \n\nYou make it to the generator and Yolan detonates the pack. You entire world erupts into flame and then oblivion. </div><div tiddler="Permanently Imprisoned" tags="" created="201502181959" modifier="twee" twine-position="772,1216">You spend the rest of your years in a prison.

Besides I had too much pride to leave my home. Everything I cared about and everything I knew was at home so that is where I went. Only when I got to my neighborhood it did not feel like home anymore. Debris from protests and riots covered the streets yet there was no one in sight. My community had changed from a tight knit neighborhood to a wasteland. I cautiously made my way into my apartment. I closed and locked the door behind me. It was dark; it seemed the neighborhood lost electricity. I took a few steps into the dark and then I felt a stiff object placed to the back of my head and heard the cock of the gun “you better have a good reason to be here” said a voice I instantly recognized as my neighbor. “Demitri?” I questioned. He put the gun down realizing it was me and apologized. \nApparently Demitri had been hiding out in my apartment after the police began searching homes. He also dodged the draft. He explained that those who were protesting, rioting, or caught dodging the draft were all captured and taken to concentration camps. He also explained that not everyone was caught and that many had taken refuge in a few different buildings throughout the city but he only knew of one location. We discussed different plans of action but by this time it was well past dusk. We decided that it would not be safe to stay in my apartment for much longer and that we should make our way to the safe house location soon but there was also the risk of being captured at night since officers were patrolling the streets so it may have been better to wait until morning.\n\n[[Wait until Dawn to travel to the Safe House]]\n[[Take the Risk of Traveling the Streets at Night]]\n</div><div tiddler="Plant the explosives a day in advance" tags="" created="201502181928" modifier="twee" twine-position="1033,578">You are spotted by patrols and shot dead.

I took cover in the bedroom. The officer burst in, and Demetri fired killing the officer instantly. We made our way out of the building as fast as we could and ran to the safe house a few blocks away.\n\nThe safe house was an apartment complex, much bigger than I'd imagined but it did not look like anyone was inside. We made our way around the back and opened the fence. There was a bulkhead for the basement that Demetri stomped his foot on in a rhythmic pattern and then it opened. When we entered we were greeted by Demetri's cousin Marc. The building was crowded. There were people sleeping on the floor, and cots spread throughout the building but most were occupied.\n\nMarc had organized a crew and had multiple plans of action. The primary goal that everyone had agreed on was to free the prisoners at the concentration camp but first we needed supplies. There was a local pharmacy and market that we needed to loot for antibiotics and food. A lot of people were becoming ill and it was a top priority to get them treated. The other plan of action was to loot the hardware and gun store for supplies to raid the concentration camp. \n\n[[Loot the pharmacy and market]]\n[[Loot the hardware and gun store]]</div><div tiddler="Set them off" tags="" created="201502190912" modifier="twee" twine-position="1640,1911">You hit the detonator and the explosions go off, following by a much larger one from the generator. You turn tail and run, not looking back. By the time you're safely away, the training facility and most of the city are up in flames. \n\nYou return back to your home country and are given a hero's welcome. With their capitol city in ruins and their primary training camp destroyed, the enemy quickly surrenders and the war is over. </div><div tiddler="attempt to hop on the train" tags="" created="201502181946" modifier="twee" twine-position="1181,715">Guards quickly spot you attempting to get near the train.

It took weeks to gain control over them. Many crew members died during those few weeks and when we returned to the safe house many people had died from their illnesses as well. There was no way we'd be able to raid the concentration camp in this condition. The only good news was that the safe houses in the surrounding neighborhood were willing to work together to take control of the city. Demetri and I were chosen to lead our own crews. Our first objectives were to take control of the police station and the hospital.\n\n[[Take control of the police station]]\n[[Take control of the hospital]]</div><div tiddler="Shoot the governor" tags="" created="201502190924" modifier="twee" twine-position="945,2036">You spin around and fire the pistol directly at the governor. He falls to the ground dead. You see a flash of satisfaction in Yolan's eyes. But a bullet hits you, fired by one of the guards, and you drop to the ground.

Then they shot me.\n</div><div tiddler="Gunslinger" tags="" created="201502182118" modifier="twee" twine-position="558,1633">You throw charges onto the walls and bring them crashing down with an explosion.

They scatter, dropping before the SMG's payload. You the draw the two pistols, mowing down the guards as they run for cover. \n\nThey finally manage to capture you and drag you into an interrogation room. The officer interrogating you looks afraid but also oddly interested.\n\n&quot;I have a proposition for you,&quot; he says, &quot;We need an insane personal like you for a mission.

I obliged and he returned to his car. Another police car pulled up and parked in front of me. I was beginning to panic. The officer exited his car and began speaking with the officer that pulled me over. I could barely make out what they were saying except for one word “draft”. I opened my door and made a run for it.

They did overcome but there were many casualties. \n\nAfter the prisoners were freed from the camp, revolution was inevitable. Across the country many cities did the same and it was not long before the people gained control of the nation.\n\n\n</div><div tiddler="Join the Gang" tags="" created="201502181800" modifier="twee" twine-position="952,287">I was given a motorcycle but was told I must earn my club patches. To do so I was told to head out with a crew to take care of some business on the streets. I obliged. \n\nAlthough I quickly realized the members of the club were some of the most evil men I have ever encountered. They were murderers, thieves, scoundrels. My first mission I was told to arrive at the police chief's home and take out his family to send a message. That is not what I had in mind when I joined this club. Once again I found myself at a crossroads. I narrowed it down to two decisions. I take out the club members, or I take my motorcycle and ride off into the sunset.\n\n[[Take out the club members]]\n[[Ride off into the sunset]]</div><div tiddler="kill Yolan" tags="" created="201502190924" modifier="twee" twine-position="948,1903">&quot;I'll kill him,&quot; you say.

Clearly a pre-recording. &quot;Now enroute to Isiphetho Shores.&quot;\n\nSo this section of the base is mobile.

The war was an excuse to gain and control natural resources and it was no secret. The majority of the draftees consisted of both men and women from the poorest regions of the nation. It was genocide. The youth of poverty stricken areas would be sent off to die, while the rich were exempt. \n\nI packed my bag and headed to the closest military base for a physical evaluation. If I passed I would report directly to boot camp. But when I got close to the base I pulled over and thought long and hard about my choices. I could accept my fate and die for my country, or I could dodge the draft. I knew deep down in my heart that I could not participate in this corrupt system. This is not my war. My war is a civil war.\n\nI made my decision. Some may claim it was cowardice but I can tell you that it took a lot more courage to fight the system rather than die for the system. Now I have to figure out a plan. I could go home and rally together the people in my community, but there will be a warrant out for my arrest since I’ve dodged the draft, or I can head for the border although since the war began border control has increased and I may not be able to cross undetected.\n\n[[Go Home|Go Home]]\n[[Head for the Border|Head for the border]]\n</div><div tiddler="Shoot her" tags="" created="201502182146" modifier="twee" twine-position="692,1630">You draw your guns, the stocks snapping into place as you release a hail of bullets into Sanchez's chest.

Years later, you're released in a prisoner exchange back to the enemy nation.

You look forward again - a man in a white cloat and glasses is crouching in front of you. He looks through his glasses at you curiously, as if observing some strange new discovery. \n\nYou give a weak smile, all your confidence drained. You know this is the end. Wrong door.

You might have been a little excessive with the distraction, I was hoping you'd draw their attention, not destroy their entire fortifications. But seeing as you opened the floodgate so to speak, I've radioed our nearest encampment. They're moving in now. Should be able to take the HQ easily. Good job, rookie. That's a pretty good win for us.&quot;\n\nYou continue to do run missions with Garland for the remainder of the war. The taking of the enemy's forward command center marks a turning point in the war, and its soon over. \n\nYou and Garland continue to work together, but while she never lets you forget that you started out as a rookie, you come to be one of the most effecient teams in the ops program.</div><div tiddler="In the Server Room Detected" tags="" created="201502182127" modifier="twee" twine-position="562,1767">You spare the guard's life and moments later, you hear alarm claxons blarring.

I took the position to run the police station. Meanwhile the people of the city were able to free the others at the concentration camp and take control of the city. Years passed and we have taken control of our area, yet the war still rages on.

Although at least this time it was for a cause that I believed in. Over the next year I was trained to handle an M16, an AK-47, and demolitions. My first mission was to plant explosives on a train bridge that the government was going to be using to deliver weapons of mass destruction to its army bases in the northern part of the country. If it was successful it would delay the launch of these weapons and would buy more time for the rebels to stop them altogether. If it was unsuccessful it is likely that the government would ultimately over power the rebels and take complete control of the war. The only problem was that if I planted the explosives too soon I may be caught and the explosives detected by patrolling officers, but if I planted them too late the weapons of mass destruction may be delivered. It was up to me to make a decision.\n\n[[Plant the explosives a day in advance]]\n[[Plant the explosives the day of delivery]]\n\n\n</div><div tiddler="Sticking Together" tags="" created="201502182020" modifier="twee" twine-position="194,1350">Garland takes point and you move forward through the base, silently incapacitating guards until you reach the server room.

We agreed that the night may be to our advantage to sneak by the patrols. There were a couple of close calls but we made it to the safe house with no problems.\n\nThe safe house was an apartment complex, much bigger than I'd imagined but it did not look like anyone was inside. We made our way around the back and opened the fence. There was a bulkhead for the basement that Demetri stomped his foot on in a rhythmic pattern and then it opened. When we entered we were greeted by Demetri's cousin Marc. The building was crowded. There were people sleeping on the floor, and cots spread throughout the building but most were occupied.\n\nMarc had organized a crew and had multiple plans of action. The primary goal that everyone had agreed on was to free the prisoners at the concentration camp but first we needed supplies. There was a local pharmacy and market that we needed to loot for antibiotics and food. A lot of people were becoming ill and it was a top priority to get them treated. The other plan of action was to loot the hardware and gun store for supplies to raid the concentration camp. \n\n[[Loot the pharmacy and market]]\n[[Loot the hardware and gun store]]</div><div tiddler="&quot;No, we're not using bio weapons&quot;" tags="" created="201502190934" modifier="twee" twine-position="1732,2195">&quot;Fine, then let's just blow the damn things to hell,&quot; Yolan snaps, but you notice him slip the launcher into his backpack. \n\nYou place the charges all across the armory, then make your escape.
