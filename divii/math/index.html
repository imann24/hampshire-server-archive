            <h2><br>Linear Algebra</h2>
            <p>
                Linear Algebra challenged my thinking about dimensions, vectors, and matrices. 
                Overtime, I was able to see the applications to computer science in animation,
                3D simulations, and graphics. Having taken the course, I'm able to apply these abstract
                concepts surrounding matrices to my work engineering in games and algorithms.

                Calculus in Context (Calculus I )
            </h2>
            <p>
                Calculus describes the nature of change and growth mathematically.
                It is able to model a variety of real world applications.
                The most direct link I found in computer science was another
                abstract one: asymptotic analysis of algorithms. Having taken courses
                in both, the concept of derivatives seems increasingly crucial.

            <h2><br>Discrete Mathematics</h2>
            <p>
                Discrete Math was laid the
                groundwork for many computer science concepts I later encounterd.
                It focused on number and graph theory. Number theory is
                applicable to runtime complexity analysis. Graph theory
                mirrors the abstract graph data structure in computer science; the parallels
                between math and computer science are boundless in this area.
