            <h2><br>Fundamentals</h2>
            <p>
                I took introductory and fundamental courses at Smith, Hampshire, and Amherst College. I found Smith's computer science highly challenging, but engagingly applied. Hampshire's was project based, with a secondary focus on skills. Amherst's System courses were the most challenging. They were deeply theoretical and abstract. They also focused on hardware which has been the least relevant subfield to my concentration.

            <p>The more I code: the more I see the potential for entropy. This is why I want to pursue a career as a software engineer. I want to battle against chaos in  code: striving to bring order to something that is inherently disorganized. As I've progressed through Division II, I've strived to write my code to be modular and reusable. Especially in my final semester, I've found myself able to reuse larger chunks of code and logic because I designed them in a way that fits many problems and applications.</p>

                I developed a variety of different code and programs for a range systems. My new learning spanned web development, graphics, artificial intelligence, and modular programming. I endeavored to bring the core concepts from these courses back into my coding repertoire. I learned about the Model View Controller Architecture, search algorithms, the Law of Demeter, raycasting, and web frameworks through these studies.
