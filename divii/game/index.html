            <h2><br>Coursework</h2>
            <p>
                When I began with game development, I was a gameplay programmer on a single game. Three semesters later, I worked three different developer roles simultaneously: gameplay engineer for Fay Games, producer for Lex The Wizard, and lead programmer for Pirate Squabbles. Game development has becoming an increasingly demanding part of my curriculum. This is in parallel with the demands of industry, but most professional game developers are not full-time college students.

                GlowLime Games is a student game development studio serving the Five Colleges. 
                I founded it alongside a group of student managers from around the Five Colleges.
                Together we setup our organizational structure and created an operating agreement.
                We've hosted game development events on the campuses, attended networking conventions,
                and managed five student game projects. Overall, GlowLime is poised to promote more
                game development opportunities for students. I've spent a great deal of my time during
                my second year of Division II working on it, and I believe it will make an excellent
                Division III project.

                Alongside our Technical Department: Eddie Pantridge and Grace Barrett-Snyder, I've spent

            <h2><br>Internships</h2>
            <p>
                My first internship in games was the MassDiGI Summer Innovation program. 
                This program was full-time during the Summer of 2015.
                I worked as the producer and a programmer on a team of seven students.
                Over the course of 11 weeks, we developed a mobile game: <i>Crafting Life</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                The two following internships were through developers I'd met during the summer program.
                The first was as the web developer for a small team of developers who worked on the
                banner of <i>Mustachio Games</i> to build a turn based strategy game: <i>Red Survivor</i>
                . The second internship was for Petricore Games, a independent studio that started out
                of MassDiGI and its summer program. During my time at Petricore, I contributed to an update
                to their published title <i>Mind the Arrow</i>
            </p>
